# Task Manager & Daily Habit Tracker

A feature-rich C application for managing daily tasks, tracking habits, reviewing progress, and planning work visually. It combines task organization, priority-based scheduling, habit streak analytics, and report generation into a single command-line productivity dashboard.

This project is designed as a practical C programming exercise and also works as a real personal productivity tool for daily planning.

---

## Overview

The application provides:

- Task creation with date and priority
- Search and filtering by date
- Pending-task viewing
- Marking tasks as completed
- Task deletion
- Habit tracking with daily completion logs
- Streak calculation and performance statistics
- Calendar visualization with color-coded priority levels
- HTML export for quick reporting and sharing
- Persistent storage through text files
- Command-line options for quick access and automation

It is built as a multi-file C project using modular code, dynamic memory, structured data, and file-based persistence.

## Main Features

### 1. Task Management

The core of the app is the task manager.

- Add a task with:
  - date in `DD-MM-YYYY` format
  - title
  - priority: `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
  - automatic status: `Pending`
- Each task receives a unique numeric ID automatically.
- Tasks are stored in memory and saved permanently in `tasks.txt`.
- Tasks can be listed in pending-state view.
- Tasks can be searched by exact date.
- Tasks can be marked as `Done`.
- Tasks can be removed from the list.
- Tasks are sorted by date, then by task ID.

This makes the planner more useful for daily planning, milestone tracking, and short-term scheduling.

### 2. Priority-Based Planning

Each task includes a priority level:

- High: critical or urgent work
- Medium: normal priority work
- Low: optional or flexible tasks

This priority is used in the calendar display and helps the user quickly identify what needs attention soon.

### 3. Search by Date

The app allows the user to search all tasks scheduled for a specific date.

Example:

```bash
./todo --date 26-09-2026
```

This shows every task scheduled on that date, making it easier to organize the day or review specific deadlines.

### 4. Dashboard Interface

The app uses a menu-driven dashboard with numbered options. The interface includes:

- Add Task
- View All Pending Tasks
- Search Task by Date
- Mark a Task Done
- Delete Task
- Daily Habits Dashboard
- Show Calendar
- Export Tasks to HTML
- Exit

This keeps the application easy to use in a terminal environment while still being feature-rich.

### 5. Daily Habit Tracker

The habit system helps users build good routines and monitor consistency.

Features:

- Add a habit with name and scheduled time (`HH:MM`)
- View today’s habits
- Toggle a habit as complete or incomplete
- Delete habits when no longer needed
- Track completion logs in `habit_log.txt`
- Calculate habit completion percentage
- Measure current streak of successful days
- Identify neglected habits based on recent performance

Habit logic includes a threshold-based completion rule:

- A day is considered successful when at least 80% of habits are completed.
- The current streak increases when consecutive days qualify.
- Performance reporting shows recent completion rates over a configured number of days.

### 6. Streak and Performance Analytics

The app includes a lightweight habit analytics system that helps users monitor consistency.

It tracks:

- Today’s habit completion percentage
- Current streak count
- Short-term habit completion rate over recent days
- Habits marked as neglected if they fall below a threshold

These statistics encourage habit consistency and make the app feel like a daily progress tracker instead of just a task list.

### 7. Calendar View with Color Coding

The calendar module displays a month view and color-codes days with pending tasks based on task importance.

Color meanings:

- Red: high-priority tasks
- Yellow: medium-priority tasks
- Green: low-priority tasks
- Plain: no pending tasks

This visual planning aid helps users see which days are busier or more urgent at a glance.

### 8. HTML Task Export

The app can generate a simple HTML report from saved tasks.

Command:

```bash
./todo --report
```

This creates a file named `report.html` and opens it in the default browser. The exported report includes:

- task list
- done/undone summary
- progress chart
- due date information
- visual task grouping

This makes it easy to view work summaries outside the terminal and share the report if needed.

### 9. Data Persistence

The program stores user information in local files so data remains available across sessions.

Files created/used:

- `tasks.txt` — stores tasks
- `habits.txt` — stores habit definitions
- `habit_log.txt` — stores habit completion records
- `report.html` — generated export report

This gives the project a realistic personal management tool feel, not just a demo console app.

### 10. Command-Line Convenience

The application supports multiple command-line operations directly from the terminal.

Supported options:

```bash
./todo --help
./todo --tut
./todo --data
./todo --report
./todo --clear
./todo --date DD-MM-YYYY
./todo --habit
```

Examples:

```bash
./todo --help
./todo --date 20-10-2026
./todo --habit
./todo --report
```

This makes the program suitable for quick runs, automation, and efficient daily usage.

## How the App Works

### Task Data Model

Tasks are stored using a structure similar to:

```c
struct Task {
    int id;
    char date[20];
    char title[100];
    char priority[10];
    char status[15];
};
```

This stores:

- a unique task ID
- due date
- task description/title
- priority
- completion state

### Habit Data Model

Habits are tracked using a structured record containing:

- habit ID
- habit name
- scheduled time
- daily completion log entries

Each log entry tracks:

- date
- habit ID
- completion state (`0` or `1`)

### Input Validation

The app validates key inputs before saving records:

- date format must be `DD-MM-YYYY`
- month must be between `1` and `12`
- day must be valid for the month
- priority must be one of `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- habit time must be in `HH:MM` format

This reduces invalid data and prevents broken scheduling.

### File Persistence Logic

The project explicitly reads and writes from text files with `fopen()`, `fscanf()`, `fprintf()`, and related C file functions.

This means:

- tasks are not lost when the application exits
- habit records remain available
- progress continues from a previous session
- report generation works using stored data

## Build and Run Instructions

### Linux/macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mugdha-sarker81/to-do-list-app-in-C.git
cd to-do-list-app-in-C
make

```

Or directly:

```bash
gcc main.c tasks.c habits.c calendar.c export.c -o todo
./todo
```

### Windows with PowerShell

If `make` is available:

```powershell
mingw32-make
mingw32-make run
```

If not, compile directly:

```powershell
gcc main.c tasks.c habits.c calendar.c export.c -o todo.exe
.\todo.exe
```

---

## Command-Line Options

```bash
./todo --help
./todo --tut
./todo --data
./todo --report
./todo --clear
./todo --date DD-MM-YYYY
./todo --habit
```

### Option Details

- `--help` : show available commands
- `--tut` : print a quick usage tutorial
- `--data` : show where the saved data is stored
- `--report` : generate and open the HTML task report
- `--clear` : delete saved task and habit data
- `--date DD-MM-YYYY` : view tasks for a specific day
- `--habit` : jump directly into the habits dashboard

## Example User Flow

### Add a task

1. Start the app
2. Select `1` from the menu
3. Enter the date in `DD-MM-YYYY`
4. Enter the task title
5. Choose a priority
6. The task is saved to `tasks.txt`

### Mark a task as done

1. View pending tasks
2. Choose the task to complete
3. Enter the task ID
4. The task status changes to `Done`

### Search tasks by date

```bash
./todo --date 25-10-2026
```

### Update habit progress

1. Open the habit dashboard
2. Add a habit
3. Mark the habit complete for today
4. View the performance and streak stats

### Generate a report

```bash
./todo --report

- Some behavior, such as clearing the screen, uses system commands and may vary slightly across operating systems.
- The generated HTML report is saved in the same directory as the application.
- Use `--clear` carefully because it removes saved progress files.

```bash
make
./todo
```

Then choose from the menu and begin managing tasks and habits immediately.
